## What is this?

This repository contains **NV Tempus**, a renamed version of [FreeFont](https://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/).

This version does not contain any glyph alterations, it only has a renamed font family name.

## How was this made?

The font was renamed and re-exported with [FontForge](https://fontforge.org).

I've included the FontForge files in this repository.
